# List of IP addresses and ports with Minecraft servers

The file in this repo, [ips](https://github.com/mat-1/minecraft-scans/raw/main/ips), contains a binary representation of most IP addresses and ports with Minecraft servers on them. You may use this to create your own Minecraft server scanner.

Each server in the file takes up 6 bytes: 4 bytes for the IPv4 and 2 bytes for the port. It updates every day at 00:00 UTC.
